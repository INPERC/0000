          my dad got cancer my life since then i've managed to wreck my life
          after i contracted covid from him it got all that much worse
          ocd anxiety doubt paranoia
          to anyone going through the same shit
          you're not alone
          it's all in your brain and how you selectively percieve information
          just do shit with your pain and don't allow this to manifest itself in unproductive non generative ways

           _realizatons so far_

           * keep your blood glucose low, this helps avoid overthinking and freezing up
              > do hard cardio
              > walk alot
              > keep digestion at peak performance

           * language is inadequete prioritize internal intuition and work output

           * don't be scared
              > move forward without doubt if you fall at least you fell, that's better than not moving
              > stop trying to self preserve
              > live every day as if it's your last and head towards your final days with pride and dignity

           * don't hate yourself
              > don't enduldge in shameful behavior that reinforces hating yourself
              > dont hate the world live for it
              > give everything you have to people you love and exapnd this loving radius


           * remember why you're here and if you don't know figure it out
              > don't buy bullshit self help shit figure it out on your own

           * it's all in your head so make your head a productive place to be
              > train your body and mind (physical an immaterail realm share information)

          else you let them win
          but they will always lose because evil always loses
          in a sense they already know they're playing a losing game
          because they hate themselves more than anyone hates them
          today in a hotel room i make this site and post it live
          maybe i will get peace this way or maybe i alleviate some suffering of another person reading this
          and those two are probably the same thing because the world moves as one


          journal:
            so what if I am a cyclical being
            I will embrace this pain and head fourth with it
            learning it's behavior to use to my advantage
            something really bad happened last year
            and will probably happen again this next year
            but I should be able to deal with it accordingly instead of always running away

    <pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">

        everything got wet | sleepless day

        journal:
          leaned into it too much to the point of where I took the wrong decision w/ regards to serving others around me
          headed more towards death than I should have in a selfish way not because it served others
          It would've served my friends and my family if I'd taken a bus went to where I had to be earlier
          not soaked my things so I'd be able to contact them
          all the decisions that were selfish piled one on top of the other
          when you stray from your path it becomes way easier to stray alot
          instead of walking in the rain I should've just taken the bus like a normal person

          on low sleep it's alot easier to get distracted by animal instincts
          haven't figured out a way to combat besides maybe music and caffeine but how long before I become caffeine adapted have to take a break and then start the cycle over again with a caffeine abstenance week
          this cyclicality makes me so depressed
          How are people able to be consistent I envy that
          I guess i should build a stronger ethical basis

          now as I write this it's my 32nd hour awake
          I look at the bed as if it is my tomb

          getting in it means I wake up a cortisol infused mess of a person that needs 5 hours to adjust to their surroundings
          i just work out but it gets very boring after a while
          wait they don't love you like I love you

          I need to find the mind pathways that can surpass these animal instinct circuits
          but maybe the animal instinct circuit is to stay awake because its afraid
          maybe there is no animal instinct circuit its all just human circuit and human is ape that can speak to itself and therefore speak to the world and it's everpresent permeating substrate the pneuma
          so i should shut that one up and go to bed
          at least at some point this cycle will have to break because my brain is getting destroyed
          but on low sleep the demons go away everything seems to quiet down and I'm able to live normally

          maybe what's really tiring is me being afraid to go to sleep
          if im going to stay awake I should do so with no doubt in my head that I should be asleep
          and if im going to sleep I should do so without doubt that I'll wake up a mess.

        status:
          out of a way to communicate with anyone back home
          laptop is fucked will fix all this shit tomorrow and go again

        some book thoughts:
          I thought the concept of adding two sinosoids together of the same frequnecy combines their amplituded to combine a 3rd sinosoid
          it's like when two people combine of the same frequency
          I wonder if there's more to that word when it comes to people vibrating than just parlance

      in this shit state of the world you really need to find
      another person that can make life less hellish for you
      luckily i think i've found at least one person
      but you have to be fully honest
      they have to see you for who you are and if they can accept that
      then you have a real friend
      and even if they betray you it's okay because at least you put out
      what you put out together
      i've been without a team for so long
      and when i did have a team i was still alone
      now i feel like we are two sine waves operating on the same frequency
      maybe with differnt PHIs but that's okay because atleast
      we're composing another sine wave
      not an aliased to shit mess

      yesterday we stayed without sleep and we drifted both in the physical sense and in the mind sense
      we got distracted
      took to many stops in the mind and on our walk to the temple
      because we straid from the heavenly way
      when on low sleep we need to find a way to stay on the heavenly path
      else we risk reversing any good we do whilst on the path on good sleep

      japan is being attacked by something
      consumerism
      every corner there is a new seven eleven filled with western pastry products filled with carbs and fat
      why is the nation allowing this diabetes capture to happen ?

      why is the system giving me angels all of a sudden
      maybe i decided to give myself them
      because i got tired of being sad

      i think i've found the solution
      i will not fear the sleep schdule fluctuations
      thus I will not ever be on low sleep
      these fears were imposed on me by father about adhering to a consistent schedule,
      when the world in it's current state does not call for it
      it calls for action

      i will go to sleep when I've done my work and when I feel tired
      the ideal for me is to wake up at mid afternoon
      and stay up until 6am then sleep for 6 - 8 hours
      during the night i'll be able to focus on code since there will be no distractions
      i'll be limited to 7 eleven food so i'll also save money

      remembering:
        systems always change from the outside
        so if you want to change yourself you need to change your outside
        then get to a state when you make yourself to operate for a positive pneuma
        that's why i came here
        so now that I want to force myself to sleep i have to remind myself that my father is not here
        everything is ok
        i'm literally in the coolest place ever able to live the coolest experience of my life
        why is it that im still anxious as if im locked in my room in back home ?
        there's really no reason besides hard wiring
        it's all in your head
        it's all what you chose to percieve and think about

      main principles:
        always head froward towards death
        do what's best for the world
        make every decision based on these two principles

      it's always important that we have something to lookforward to
      even if it doesn't exist create it
      everynight you go to bed have a plan for tomorrow
      when you have a plan, especially when it's based around the well being of others
      all is well
      when you think of yourself, the eternal converstation starts you freeze
      you stop moving
      keep moving
      shut the endless eternal conversation
      find the path and head fourth without hesitation
      and so the cellular automata principle will play out to create a viable path forward
      a viable path is a good path
      a good path is the best path
      a perfect path is no path

      don't get charmed by negative omens
      they're not there to tell you that bad luck is coming
      they're a welcome reminder to stay out of your head
      and to keep heading forward no matter what

          >either don't stay on low sleep

          >or have such strong engrained ethics that you are unable to slip up under conditions where it's easy for the mind to drift into base selfish insticts and desires
            (when this happens it is quite easy to fall into a landslide of unproductive behavior that instead of serving what you truly care about serves many industries)
             that pray on this kind of behavior to keep their fake value industries alive
             we can forgive them though
             they don't make decisions on their own
             they market tells them what to do
             and the market isn't controlled by genuine value
             it's controlled by extraction mechanisms (in it's current state)
             and what it extracts is ultimately your soul

          >or just have your own schedule that is taylored to your purpose not following regular sleeping patterns of others if you can afford to
            (although in any case you should be adaptable and be able to operate in any conditions imposed by your environment)

      it's all your cortisol pathway but when you figure that out
      then it's not
      __________
      all this rushing
      you think it helps you move forward fast
      but it's just self defense against actually following through with what's infront of you
      it's still just self preservation presenting itself in different form
      what really moves you forward is confrontation
      and dealing with it
      if you hate living so much then why are you so afraid of self sacrifice ?

      stop scratching old wounds it's over
      and its better this way because if it weren't better then it wouldn't have been over yet
      next time don't lie to yourself and follow your heart
      because your heart is not your own
      it is that of the eternal spirit provided you've make yourself available to it by going to bed a dead person and being reborn in the morning
      spend it all but whilst being composed
      die with a calm expression
      wake up again and start without hesitation at peace with the cold
      keep moving or be scared and stay the same truly dying
      a shameful death
