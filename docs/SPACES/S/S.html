          my dad got cancer my life since then i've managed to wreck my life
          after i contracted covid from him it got all that much worse
          ocd anxiety doubt paranoia
          to anyone going through the same shit
          you're not alone
          it's all in your brain and how you selectively percieve information
          just do shit with your pain and don't allow this to manifest itself in unproductive non generative ways

           _realizatons so far_

           * keep your blood glucose low, this helps avoid overthinking and freezing up
              > do hard cardio
              > walk alot
              > keep digestion at peak performance

           * language is inadequete prioritize internal intuition and work output

           * don't be scared
              > move forward without doubt if you fall at least you fell, that's better than not moving
              > stop trying to self preserve
              > live every day as if it's your last and head towards your final days with pride and dignity

           * don't hate yourself
              > don't enduldge in shameful behavior that reinforces hating yourself
              > dont hate the world live for it
              > give everything you have to people you love and exapnd this loving radius


           * remember why you're here and if you don't know figure it out
              > don't buy bullshit self help shit figure it out on your own

           * it's all in your head so make your head a productive place to be
              > train your body and mind (physical an immaterail realm share information)

          else you let them win
          but they will always lose because evil always loses
          in a sense they already know they're playing a losing game
          because they hate themselves more than anyone hates them
          today in a hotel room i make this site and post it live
          maybe i will get peace this way or maybe i alleviate some suffering of another person reading this
          and those two are probably the same thing because the world moves as one


          journal:
            so what if I am a cyclical being
            I will embrace this pain and head fourth with it
            learning it's behavior to use to my advantage
            something really bad happened last year
            and will probably happen again this next year
            but I should be able to deal with it accordingly instead of always running away

        everything got wet | sleepless day

        leaned into it too much to the point of where I took the wrong decision w/ regards to serving others around me
        headed more towards death than I should have in a selfish way not because it served others
        It would've served my friends and my family if I'd taken a bus went to where I had to be earlier
        not soaked my things so I'd be able to contact them
        all the decisions that were selfish piled one on top of the other
        when you stray from your path it becomes way easier to stray alot
        instead of walking in the rain I should've just taken the bus like a normal person

        on low sleep it's alot easier to get distracted by animal instincts
        haven't figured out a way to combat besides maybe music and caffeine but how long before I become caffeine adapted have to take a break and then start the cycle over again with a caffeine abstenance week
        this cyclicality makes me so depressed
        How are people able to be consistent I envy that
        I guess i should build a stronger ethical basis

        now as I write this it's my 32nd hour awake
        I look at the bed as if it is my tomb

        getting in it means I wake up a cortisol infused mess of a person that needs 5 hours to adjust to their surroundings
        i just work out but it gets very boring after a while
        wait they don't love you like I love you

        I need to find the mind pathways that can surpass these animal instinct circuits
        but maybe the animal instinct circuit is to stay awake because its afraid
        maybe there is no animal instinct circuit its all just human circuit and human is ape that can speak to itself and therefore speak to the world and it's everpresent permeating substrate the pneuma
        so i should shut that one up and go to bed
        at least at some point this cycle will have to break because my brain is getting destroyed
        but on low sleep the demons go away everything seems to quiet down and I'm able to live normally

        maybe what's really tiring is me being afraid to go to sleep
        if im going to stay awake I should do so with no doubt in my head that I should be asleep
        and if im going to sleep I should do so without doubt that I'll wake up a mess.

        status:
          out of a way to communicate with anyone back home
          laptop is fucked will fix all this shit tomorrow and go again

        some book thoughts:
          I thought the concept of adding two sinosoids together of the same frequnecy combines their amplituded to combine a 3rd sinosoid
          it's like when two people combine of the same frequency
          I wonder if there's more to that word when it comes to people vibrating than just parlance

      in this shit state of the world you really need to find
      another person that can make life less hellish for you
      luckily i think i've found at least one person
      but you have to be fully honest
      they have to see you for who you are and if they can accept that
      then you have a real friend
      and even if they betray you it's okay because at least you put out
      what you put out together
      i've been without a team for so long
      and when i did have a team i was still alone
      now i feel like we are two sine waves operating on the same frequency
      maybe with differnt PHIs but that's okay because atleast
      we're composing another sine wave
      not an aliased to shit mess
