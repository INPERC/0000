          my dad got cancer my life since then i've managed to wreck my life
          after i contracted covid from him it got all that much worse
          ocd anxiety doubt paranoia
          to anyone going through the same shit
          you're not alone
          it's all in your brain and how you selectively percieve information
          just do shit with your pain and don't allow this to manifest itself in unproductive non generative ways

           _realizatons so far_

           * keep your blood glucose low, this helps avoid overthinking and freezing up
              > do hard cardio
              > walk alot
              > keep digestion at peak performance

           * language is inadequete prioritize internal intuition and work output

           * don't be scared
              > move forward without doubt if you fall at least you fell, that's better than not moving
              > stop trying to self preserve
              > live every day as if it's your last and head towards your final days with pride and dignity

           * don't hate yourself
              > don't enduldge in shameful behavior that reinforces hating yourself
              > dont hate the world live for it
              > give everything you have to people you love and exapnd this loving radius


           * remember why you're here and if you don't know figure it out
              > don't buy bullshit self help shit figure it out on your own

           * it's all in your head so make your head a productive place to be
              > train your body and mind (physical an immaterail realm share information)

          else you let them win
          but they will always lose because evil always loses
          in a sense they already know they're playing a losing game
          because they hate themselves more than anyone hates them
          today in a hotel room i make this site and post it live
          maybe i will get peace this way or maybe i alleviate some suffering of another person reading this
          and those two are probably the same thing because the world moves as one


          journal:
            so what if I am a cyclical being
            I will embrace this pain and head fourth with it
            learning it's behavior to use to my advantage
            something really bad happened last year
            and will probably happen again this next year
            but I should be able to deal with it accordingly instead of always running away
